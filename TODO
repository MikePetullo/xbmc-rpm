* Add PVR clients from "official" repo:

  https://github.com/opdenkamp/xbmc-pvr-addons

  Decided: we will make this a subpackage of the xbmc SRPM while
  things are in flux.  The way upstream has organized things is that
  it's apparently then possible to untar the PVR add-on directory
  inside the main xbmc in a directory called "pvr-addons", then the
  configure script will "notice" it and it will build them as part of
  the main XBMC build process (although I haven't tested this myself
  yet).

  So we should create a tarball snapshot of the git repo and include
  that in the package.

* Merge libdvdread libhomehdrun patches upstream.

  The patches must be rewritten to use the external, if found, and
  drop back to bundled versions if not before they would be allowed
  upstream.

* Package the manpages in docs/manpages as per package guidelines.

* Unbundle any other deps that can be easily unbundled.

  - tinyxml appears to be removed and it now default to external version
    See https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/1850
  
  other candidates:
  
  - libapetag, libid3tag: once this pull request goes in:
    https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/1450

  - libdvdnav: should be reworked with the libdvdread above
  
  - libmad: seems to use external library (although for some reason I
    can't see libmad.so* as a Requires in the built package) , but
    source code should be removed from lib/libmad

* EL6: Backport support for EPEL's taglib 1.6, so we can build Frodo
  on EL6.
