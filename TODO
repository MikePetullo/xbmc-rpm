* Add PVR clients.

  Decided: we will make this a subpackage of the xbmc SRPM while
  things are in flux. Once it settles down, we can evaluate moving
  this to its own package. 

* Merge libdvdread and libhomehdrun patches upstream.

  The patches must be rewritten to use the external, if found, and
  drop back to bundled versions if not before they would be allowed
  upstream.

* Package the manpages in docs/manpages as per package guidelines.

* Unbundle any other deps that can be easily unbundled.

  tinyxml may be a candidate. See https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/1850

* EL6: Backport support for EPEL's taglib 1.6, so we can build Frodo
  on EL6.
