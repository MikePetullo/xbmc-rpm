* Merge libdvdread libhomehdrun patches upstream.

  The patches must be rewritten to use the external, if found, and
  drop back to bundled versions if not before they would be allowed
  upstream.

* Package the manpages in docs/manpages as per package guidelines.

* Unbundle any other deps that can be easily unbundled.

  - tinyxml appears to be removed and it now default to external version
    See https://bugzilla.rpmfusion.org/1850
  
  other candidates:
  
  - libapetag, libid3tag: once this pull request goes in:
    https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/1450

  - libdvdnav: should be reworked with the libdvdread above
  
  - libmad: seems to use external library (although for some reason I
    can't see libmad.so* as a Requires in the built package) , but
    source code should be removed from lib/libmad

* EL6: Frodo requires taglib 1.8. Red Hat ships taglib 1.6.1 in RHEL. It
  is very unlikely that we will be able to backport support for taglib
  1.6 into newer version of XBMC because the API has changed so much. We
  would need to ship a "taglib18" package in EPEL.
